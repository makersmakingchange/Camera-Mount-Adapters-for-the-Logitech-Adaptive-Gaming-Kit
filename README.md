# Camera Mount Adapters for the Logitech Adaptive Gaming Kit

This Documentation covers information for both the full kit (12 adapters) and for a single adapter for one button.

The Camera Mount Adapters for Logitech Adaptive Gaming Kit are inexpensive, easy, and quick to build adapters for the four different Buttons from the [Logitech Adaptive Gaming Kit](<https://www.logitechg.com/en-ca/products/gamepads/adaptive-gaming-kit-accessories.943-000318.html/>). These adapters allow the buttons to be mounted on standard camera mounting equipment using the standard camera mount threads (¼”-20 UNC). These adapters were originally designed by [ATMakers](<http://atmakers.org/>) and more information on their switch mounts is available [here](<http://atmakers.org/2017/02/at-switch-adapters/>).

## Getting Started

### 1. Order the Off-The-Shelf Components

The [Bill of Materials](/Documentation/Camera_Adapter_Logitech_BOM_V1.1.csv) lists all of the parts and components required to build the Camera Mount Adapter for Logitech Adaptive Gaming Kit. Everything can either be 3D printed or bought at the local hardware store. 


### 2. Print the 3D Printable components

All of the files and individual print files can be in the [/Build_Files/](/Build_Files/) folder.

### 3. Assemble the device.

Reference the [Assembly Guide](/Documentation/Camera_Adapter_Logitech_Assembly_Guide_V1.1.pdf) for the tools and steps required to build the devices.
